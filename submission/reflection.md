# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
What tools did you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? How did they help?
Answer: For this job, I mainly used ChatGPT as my AI helper. It was a great support to me during the whole development of the Weather Advisor project. Whenever I was unclear about the assignment, I needed to plan the module structure or I couldn't figure out how to fix my code because an error was thrown unexpectedly, I simply consulted ChatGPT. In addition, ChatGPT helped me to conceive functions like get_weather_data, create_temperature_visualization and parse_weather_question. By employing this tool, I was able to concentrate on the logic, the design and the solving of the problem instead of performing the monotonous coding tasks. I discovered that AI can be a great productivity booster if one is careful and critical in its use, instead of merely taking a shortcut.

## Prompting Techniques
Which intentional prompting strategies did you apply?
Answer: I used intentional prompting techniques when I was talking to ChatGPT. Broad questions like "fix my code" were not asked by me, rather I gave specific and detailed instructions like "Explain why this function isn’t returning the forecast data correctly and how to optimise it."?. More precise and insightful answers resulted from this manner. Additionally, I broke down the project into the parts: API integration, data parsing, and data visualization and utilized prompts to delve into each field gradually. As a result, I got a better understanding of the correct way to give instructions to AI and the effect that clear communication has on the quality of the output.

## What Worked Well?
Describe one thing you’re proud of.
Answer: One of the main strengths of this project was how I successfully combined my own analytical thinking with AI advice. ChatGPT was like a helpful mentor all through the development process, it assisted me in catching logic errors, clarifying Python syntax, and making the overall structure of my functions more efficient. I was the one who decided the directions and logic of the program, but with the help of ChatGPT's explanations, I was able to code in a way that was more readable and the performance of the program was better. Using matplotlib for visualizing temperature and rainfall was really a great part of the project as it helped me to present the weather data in a way that was both easy to understand and attractive. So, the partnership between human intellect and AI support led to a more effective workflow and gave me a deeper understanding of modular programming, data presentation, and problem-solving strategies.

## What Would You Do Differently?
Describe one thing you'd change if you had more time.
Answer: If time was on my side, I would concentrate on enhancing the user experience and strengthening the application. As an example, automated tests might be implemented, and the software would be more stable if it had better exception handling for invalid locations. I could also go deep into a straightforward conversational model or a rule-based response system so that the user's interaction would be the natural way of communication. Additionally, a transformation would be having properly organized documentation for each development stage so that the subsequent changes could be located and understood quickly.

## Final Thoughts
Any parting comments on your learning experience?
Answer: Simply put, the target project has been a significant learning journey for me and it was instrumental in my programming skills competencies enhancement in Python and AI-assisted development. There is one thing I can mention which is the manner in which you break down a complicated task into several smaller and more logical tasks, the usage of modular design principles, and the consideration of AI as a co-learning partner rather than a helper. It was, in particular, the deliberate prompting method that helped me to sharpen my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Besides increasing my technical skills, this project has been very instrumental to me in realising the integration of two human creativity and AI, for not only coming up with innovative but also practical and visually attractive software.
